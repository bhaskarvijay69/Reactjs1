Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.


It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run it on CLI(Command Line Interface):



npx create-react-app my-app #for creating react app,


cd my-app # and then change the drive,


npm start #start your react app by using npm command,

NPM is short for node package manager, an online directory that contains the various already registered open-source packages. NPM modules consume the various functions as a third-party package when installed into an app using the NPM command npm install.
